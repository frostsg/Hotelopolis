"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,Pleasant 10 min walk along the sea front to the Water Bus. restaurants etc. Hotel was comfortable breakfast was good - quite a variety. Room aircon didn't work very well. Take mosquito repelant!,4
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,Really lovely hotel. Stayed on the very top floor and were surprised by a Jacuzzi bath we didn't know we were getting! Staff were friendly and helpful and the included breakfast was great! Great location and great value for money. Didn't want to leave!,5
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,"We stayed here for four nights in October. The hotel staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful. Assisted in booking tickets for the opera. The rooms were clean and comfortable- good shower, light and airy rooms with windows you could open wide. Beds were comfortable. Plenty of choice for breakfast.Spa at hotel nearby which we used while we were there.",5

"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,"We loved staying on the island of Lido! You need to take a water is from Venice to get there. From the train station, a boat ride takes 45 minutes but has beautiful views along the way. Hotel is an EASY walk from the boat dock. The room was very clean and the breakfast was plentiful. We would definitely recommend this hotel!",5
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,Lovely view out onto the lagoon. Excellent view. Staff were welcoming and helpful.,4
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,It was ok hotel is nice from in and out but room was small we paid for double bed bat they atteched 2 single bed,3
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable. My wife and I had a room with a terrace over looking the water...it was a great view! I will look to stay at this hotel my next time in Venice...very pleased.,4
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,"Nice hotel , with very friendly staff and helpful - great choice for breakfast , something for everyone.",4
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,"DON'T stay here unless you're less than 2 feet tall or like sleeping with centipedes. Our 4th floor room was an attic with a vaulted ceiling that angles down to 3ft. The bed is only accessible from one side. If you placed your head in the skylight on the other side you might able sit up. The bathtub was impractical with broken shower head. We moved to the 1st floor the next day and within minutes found a centipede on the wall and15 flies. We asked for a broom to get rid of the centipede. Later in the day the receptionist said she gave us something to control the bugs. We never complained about the drain flies so she must have noticed a problem. That night we spent 2 hrs catching 6 centipedes in our room. 2 came from throw pillows. We asked reception for a new room or hotel but there supposedly weren't any hotels with open rooms and if we wanted leave we would have to pay for transportation and both hotels. The next morning we went to reception to tell them about the bug problem. We barely said anything before the woman apologized and said they didn't put the bugs in the room on purpose so we should just go about our day and forget it. She added that she often goes on vacation with her children and sometimes things happen, so she tries to make the best of everything and not start a war. Adding, a few euros isn't going to make anything go away so we should just go enjoy the day because more we talk the less time we have.",1
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,"We had absolutely no problems whatsoever with this hotel and were very pleasantly surprised by the quality considering the low price. The dcor of the room was pleasant and flawless, unlike many of the Venice hotels I've stayed in. The breakfast buffet was delicious too. And to finish all this off, the staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. In terms of location, the hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the Lido waterbus stop, then a boat takes around 15 mins to get into Venice. We didn't find this a problem at all - we knew this was going to be the case so had pre-booked transport tickets to save money. The surrounding Lido is pleasant and worth an explore in a spare couple of hours. In conclusion, I would book this again due to the fantastic quality of the hotel, despite the trade-off of not being in Venice itself.",5
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,"Lovely hotel, 10 min walk to the water bus stop on lido. Away from the madness of Venice, but close enough to be there in less than 20 minutes.",5
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,"Das Hotel liegt auf der Insel Lido neben Venedig, direkt am Meer mit Blick auf Venedig. Lido kann man sehr gut mit den Booten erreichen. Vom Bootsanlegeplatz sind es ca. 400 m zum Hotel an der Kste entlang. Den Weg mussten wir zu Fu zurcklegen, da keine Busse wegen einer Baustelle dorthin fahren. Wir wurden sehr freundlich empfangen, berhaupt war das Personal im Hotel sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Das Zimmer war gemtlich eingerichtet, das Bad relativ gro und alles sehr sauber und ordentlich. Auch mit dem Frhstcksbffet waren wir sehr zufrieden - gute Qualitt und relativ groe Auswahl. Wir waren rundherum zufrieden und wrden das Hotel sofort wieder buchen.",5
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,"Located on the Lido I would recommend this hotel if you require a little piece and quiet after the busy day's in Venice, facility's good, staff very friendly and very helpful. I requested flowers for the room as it was one of my wife's special birthday's, and yes they ordered exactly as requested, can't ask for more. Rooms are a little on the small side but in line with most European hotels of this standard so wasn't a surprise or a problem, room and bathroom was cleaned every day with fresh towels supplied each day. Buffet breakfast had various options to suit most peoples taste but It was a surprise to see sausage, bacon and scrambled eggs available, must have been put on to satisfy us Brits! We stayed during late September so the Lido is probably quieter at that time however we felt very safe walking around late at night back to the hotel but taxis are available if you feel a little vulnerable. Restaurants and coffee bars are located in the main commercial area close to the Waterbus stations and tend to be slightly cheaper than in Venice. We had a water taxi (think luxury speed boat!) from the airport to the hotel and back again, quite an experience, a little costly but well worth it, a lot quicker and less hassle than the Waterbus. Venice was very busy during the day time, St Marks Square at night is a must, fantastic atmosphere. All in all we had a great time in Venice, it can be a little expensive so don't ponder over the bills to much, just pay up with a smile!",5
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,Great stay...close to ferry.food not so good nearby,4
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,"Stayed with parents, wife twin toddlers in two triple rooms. The hotel is easy to reach and the rooms were well placed well furnished. The best feature was extremely friendly helpful staff, particularly Ms. Annalucia Ms. Anna who were always ready to listen help out with big smiles. The breakfasts were very good, with good spread and the guests were made welcome to sit and eat at leisure (more important when you are with toddlers!) Would surely go back to Venice would happily stay again at Russo Palace.",5
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,This hotel is in Lido which is a better choice than staying in crowded Venice. The water bus is very convenient and it takes only few more stops to the main attractions in Venice. We received excellent service - many thanks to Anna and Donnatella who made us feel at home.,4
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,"It was a 10 min+ walk to water bus, would have liked it closer. Located on the water on Lido island, away from the rush of Venice",4
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,Room was tiny-bed saggy-bAthroom door didn't work. Good breakfast and convenient location. Wouldn't return or recommend.,3
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,"VERY FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL WITH DIRECTIONS, KNOWING ALL THE RIGHT PLACES TO VISIT AND WHERE TO EAT TH BEST FOOD IN THE AREA. The Front Desk Receptionists were extremely helpful ..especially Sabrina who made us feel very welcomed to Lido....We will be back next year for sure!",5
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,No shower but jets in the bathtub and my room was slanted but made it work,4
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,"Really enjoyed the stay, about a 10min walk to the main waterbus station. Had the perfect quiet location and staff were really friendly!!",5
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,"Walls extremely thin, you can hear everything. Excessive hoovering every morning outside bedroom. There. Is a bar, but no one to tend it.",2
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,"If you're looking for a hotel where the action is, go elsewhere. The hotel is on the Lido, which is about a 10-15 minute waterbus ride away from Venice. However, if you're looking for a place on the Lido, this is a well-priced option. The staff was great with handling/recommending dinner reservations, even during an insane Carnevale weekend. The doors are a little thin and since the building is old, the soundproofing needs improvement. The quarters are cramped, but the room comes with breakfast. If we wanted to stay on the Lido again, this would be a good option, but next time I think we'll opt for a place closer to the action. Recommended.",3
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,"Hotel facilities are good and breakfast ample. Econmy rooms have sloping roof so tall guests mind your head We stayed in one and it was fine, the occational bump but for the price you cant really complain.",4
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,Friendly reception very helpful. Hotel has pleasant views and is about ten minute walk to main water bus terminal to take you any direction. We used the spa one day. Good saunas but relaxation area noisy and small. Some lovely restaurants close by and cheaper than in Venice.,4
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,It was a bit far from city center,4
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,"Great hotel, staff where amazing and the location and views make this a great Base to visit Venice!",5
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,"Close to Venice and decent hotel, breakfast was okay with no too much selection but has everything you need.",4
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,"beautiful views of Venice in the lovely relaxed calmer area of Lido Di Venezia. Gorgeous sunsets and very easy to access Venice, rather than satying in the hustle and bustle. Close to only beaches in Venice. Staff were so helpful, especially Ivan and the lady we met on the desk each morning.",4
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,This is a great little hotel. We had a wonderful view from the room and patio. Good size. Breakfast was great even had North American breakfast foods. Only issue was the two twin beds pushed together. That was very uncomfortable.,4
"Riviera San Nicol 11/a, 30126",Hotel Russo Palace,"Nice staff. Nice location. We booked two nights at Russo hotel on Lido strip and two nights in the very center of Venice. This is a good balance. Lido is a bit further but it feels more local and is more relaxing too, it gave us a taste of Dolce Vita. We didn't see it on the hotel description but they offered us a taxi boat ride to Murano with another couple for free. The boat ride was very pleasant, they dropped us in a glass blowing factory shop, the glass making demonstration was nice and there was very little pressure to buy. Internet was free for 20 minutes/day but a bit slow like everywhere in Venice. So in short a good pick, good value for money.",5

We were told we had one of the best rooms, besides staring at cargo containers, the TV would not work so they changed our room. It was not well furnished and we could not regulate the air conditioner (way too warm for sleeping). The continental breakfast was good and the staff was very nice and helpful.

When I lay down on the bed, all I could smell was dirty old sweat socks! I don't think they ever used detergent or fabric softener to wash the linens!They were that horrible! I had to spray the linens with perfume so I wouldn't smell them 'au naturel' while I'm sleeping! I'm never going to stay in this hotel ever again!",2

I thought I was staying in wine country. It would also have been nice to know that it is under construction. Granted I should have done more research but it was a last minute decision to go. The only good thing I could say is the bed was comfortable. If you are looking for a hotel right off of a freeway this one fits the bill, although way overpriced.",3

When we first entered our room and kicked off our shoes, we found ourselves stepping on numerous sand burrs left on the carpet.

We pickup a beagle and coffee and went to our room. They should have planned ahead for all the teens to eat all the food. There was 45 minutes left for breakfast time but nothing to eat.

The hotel is located near the freeway. There is a gas station, fast food, and shopping nearby. We were in town for a family event so we didn't do much exploring, but there seemed to be many amenities right in the area. The best part was the proximity to downtown Livermore.

The bathroom tub could use an update...but I have stayed in the W in downtown Chicago and the tub was worse and room was horrible. I'd take this room over that one any day! The breakfast the next morning was good. Nothing to write home about, but it offers a great selection and the eggs weren't watered down. Sausage was good...bacon...well, that looked and smelled like a dog treat. Passed on that one.

When I mentioned the unattractiveness to the desk clerk she acknowledged the problem and very nicely explained that the place was due for a major overhaul.

When I went to front desk to see about having it removed, I had to wait about 10 minutes for desk person who apparently was only staff person on duty and was working desk and dealing with room issues - she went with me to room to remove bed. Also, lobby was a little iffy - lobby restroom was not clean and, there was a carpet runner in the lobby that was really several pieces of leftover wall-to-wall remnants that had been hand cut - a bit tacky and a tripping hazard.

However the rest of our stay, and we did add an extra night, more than made up for it.

I would not order room service again if I stayed again. The coffee shop downstairs has bad service. Waiters barely acknowledge you. Would I stay again? If they change the room service provider, then I’ll come back.",

I stayed in about 3 hotels around the same area that defines as 5 stars hotel without mention names, but to me: EQ hotel (premier king infinity room) has the best view, because from the room I can see the twin towers and kuala lumpur tower as well, and all the wall are glass even in the bathroom. Second, the hospitality: I am speechless about the hospitality because I can’t find a word to describe how they were. They will make you feel that you are the only guest in the hotel. From my experience, you may find in each hotel in Kuala Lumpur same view and you will like one more than the other, but there isn’t the same level of the hospitality as…",

I had one issue regarding an issue with an extra bed we required for our room but it was quickly resolved and the manager went to huge lengths to apologise. Breakfast buffet was very good and I must mention the staff there who not only quickly learned our names but also which drink we preferred to have at breakfast. This is quite a feat given the large numbers of guests passing through the hotel. The hotel is very close to a monorail station and only a few minutes walk from KLCC and The Pavilion.

I was upgraded to bigger and better room. The deco was amazing and even had chocolate complimentary from the Chef. Do I have to say more? Unfortunately I was not able to experience the hotel utilities and restaurants due to the pandemic. But for sure I will be back to your hotel once all this have been cleared to …",

"Equatorial Plaza Jalan Sultan Ismail, Kuala Lumpur 50250 Malaysia",EQ Kuala Lumpur,"The Equatorial is one of the older names in the Kuala Lumpur (KL) hospitality industry. The original hotel opened in 1973 and was one of the mainstays on Jalan Sultan Ismail, one of the main thoroughfares of KL. So it was quite sad to hear of the hotel closing down for redevelopment back in 2012. But perhaps the fears were misplaced, as although the new redevelopment tore down the old structure and rebuilt an entirely new mixed development called the Equatorial Plaza, the hotel was still a key part of the Equatorial Plaza. Fast forward to 2019, and the new hotel, now called the EQ, was reopened for business, in the Plaza.

"132 West 47TH Street, New York City, NY 10036",Sanctuary Hotel New York,"I've stayed in many NYC hotels over the last 30 years. For me and my husband this was excellent because our room was sooooooo quiet and they have the proper shades and window coverings so that you can blackout all light. We could not have cared less that the room was small, they make excellent use of a small space....we're only there to basically sleep and be in a great location to all the museums, shows, etc. The staff was great, the place was totally clean. Will definitely return.", 
"132 West 47TH Street, New York City, NY 10036",Sanctuary Hotel New York,"Do not believe the reviews for this hotel. Rooms are dreadful, very very small, not clean and everything is so dark. (I am pretty sure dark to hide the mess). As residents can’t even use the hotel bar as they rent it out for private functions. I was sent to the bar 4 doors down. Staff were not organised. One blamed the other but there was zero care for residents. No water to drink in the room and NO place to even buy a bottle. (Remember bar shut to residents and no room service). Honestly - worst hotel I have ever stayed in in NYC and will never be back. Finally - iron is so dirty it marked my shirt - that’s basics that need sorting. Told the concierge and reaction was non-plus. Have to wait on housekeeping coming in to sort! Dreadful dreadful - avoid.", 
"132 West 47TH Street, New York City, NY 10036",Sanctuary Hotel New York,"This hotel was great! MUCH more than I expected for around $200/night. Hotel staff was beyond friendly and helpful. The room was tastefully decorated and very clean (some furnishings a bit worn, but in a way that just indicates that this is a well-used hotel.) The bed was extremely comfortable. Continental breakfast was good (pastries, cereal, hard-boiled eggs, yogurt). Literally steps from Times Square, and about a block from the two shows we saw as well as Rockefeller Plaza. Subway access a couple of blocks away. Would ABSOLUTELY stay here again!",

We arrived New years eve and enjoyed 4 nights in this beautiful hotel. Location is fab! I was pregnant at the time so made use of the tubes at the end of our road. The hotel is right in the middle of times square which was perfect for bringing in the new year amd your just a short walk to the main attractions top of the rock and central park. We visited a show whilst there and again was in walking distance from the hotel so perfect location. I didn't pay for breakfast but I mentioned at check in we were here for a 30th and they upgraded our room and gave us complimentary breakfast. The rooms are so comfy and modern with a…,

I found the Sanctuary was close, reasonable & had a rooftop restaurant/bar. So, I booked for 2 nights. Honestly, I couldn't of asked for a better location. Half a block from the center of Times Square, the show at Fox was literally, directly across the street and great restaurants all around. The room was small, but it is NYC. It was modern, quiet & clean. The only complaint would be the door to the toilet weighed a ton and was so difficult to close, we opted to just use the curtain for the entire bathroom area, not a game changer by any means. Continental breakfast was included & was what you would normally expect. Coffee was very good, think it was Starbucks. My biggest…",

I am a travel agent in the UK and I will be recommending this hotel to all my clients, rooms are spotlessly clean, modern. Doug and Rashid who both work long hours always make time to chat and advise all visitors, they are very much an asset to the image of the Hotel.

Terrible, slow and rude customer service at the front desk. One desk person made a snide comment about my appearance, and when I politely asked if our room was available after waiting 30 minutes for it in the lobby (at the normal check in time), another front desk person told me that their policy is that the room is available anytime after 3PM, not AT 3PM, which makes no sense at all. The lobby was full of people waiting for their rooms, which took much longer than we had planned or expected.

"132 West 47TH Street, New York City, NY 10036",Sanctuary Hotel New York,We stayed June 7-10. The only reason I gave an average rating is the doormen were very friendly and helpful. The room is very small and the windows let no natural light in but that is not why I rate it low. They advertise stocked mini bar in the room. They don't have that however having an empty mini fridge is nice because you have to walk the CVS or Walgreens to purchase anything you might want to drink even water. In the reception area they do have small plastic cups in which you can get a little drink of water. We could not go to the rooftop restaurants because they were booked our entire stay. They cater to non guests. If you arrive back to the hotel as the non guests are waiting to go upstairs you will have to wait behind them to get the elevator. We were told we could go…,

The hotel is a minute walk from Time Square, 15 minutes to central Park and 15 minutes to Madison Square garden. There is a subway at the end of the street too. The room was great, although the AC was very noisy and as we stayed during the hottest Temp recorded in May it was a problem as couldn't sleep, we did report the issue and maintenance attempted to fix the problem, but it didn't really solve the issue maybe slightly queiter so we just lived with it.

We booked room only, and did not expect any breakfast at all, so it was a nice surprise to get free breakfast, it did not matter that the plates and cutlery were plastic, it was free !! So we were happy enough with that. The staff were lovely. There are construction works outside, which were a little noisy at times...but it did not bother us really, it is not the hotel's fault.

"132 West 47TH Street, New York City, NY 10036",Sanctuary Hotel New York,"The picture of the lovely neoclassical facade is quite misleading. Small, dark lobby, winding dark hallway to get to our elevator. King room was too small for two persons and view from window was a concrete wall about 30 inches away. Continental breakfast was mostly prepackaged food with styrofoam plates and plastic utensils. Tidy and clean overall. The earnest and friendly staff was another saving grace.

"132 West 47TH Street, New York City, NY 10036",Sanctuary Hotel New York,I was extremely impressed by the beautiful interiors and the styling of the rooms. I cannot emphasise enough how comfortable the rooms are and partially due to the way they are styled with fabrics and colour schemes that make you feel like you are home away from home. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and the sushi restaurant is to die for., 
"132 West 47TH Street, New York City, NY 10036",Sanctuary Hotel New York,Great location if you want to be near Times Square. Fixtures and fittings are tires and dated. The bed was really comfortable if not I feel we would have been looking to find another hotel. Our room was more like a modular room as there was only a curtain separating the bedroom from the shower/sink area. Not much chance of someone sleeping while you had a shower. First impressions were great as you were welcomed by door staff before you walked into the dim lit interior. More of a outdated look rather then boutique look.,

The hotel has been renovated and up-to-date, the staff is one of the friendliest I've seen in a long time and the location is impeccable. The room is tiny, as they all tend to be in NYC, but its design is optimal with pretty much everything you need for a comfortable stay. The only tiny thing I'd suggest would be is a coffee maker.:) They serve complimentary coffee in the lobby so that makes it up.

The only criticism would be the breakfast; it was a bit basic and choices were limited however we think this was due to covid and minimising infection risk?

Our room in the East wing was small with a very nice size bathroom with a great shower. Our view was a brick wall and fire escape. The CONS Hot water took about 5 minutes to get hot wasting gallons of water. Sushi Restaurant door kept on slamming shut and people talking very loudly outside made this room very unpleasant at times Lots of construction two doors down will happen for a long time.

Which were changed every day and shower gels, shampoos and conditioner. Breakfast was a box of goodies, as much tea, coffee or juice as you like.

The front desk and concierge employees were all apathetic, honestly, about everything- even just casual pleasant conversation.

Plus, the beds here are among the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in away from home. The shower is fabulous.

I lied and said I was waiting for my husband. He was getting in late because of a delayed flight. I played with my decoy ring as we talked. I go in the room and put my lock on the door.

"132 West 47TH Street, New York City, NY 10036",Sanctuary Hotel New York,I was disappointed at this place to be honest . We paid little over $300 for one night and for the price the service was horrible . 1- they told us once we got here that the parking garage was closed and I have to go around and find another parking . In time square it took me 40 min to find another parking lot that I could leave the car over night. 2- we wanted to go to hotel restaurant and they told us they are closed to guest because of a company party 3- we asked for water they said they don’t have water and if we want water we should go outside and buy water from a food truck. With the price they are charging I would go to another hotel .,

I checked in Friday, around 10 am. Upon coming in, I was told they had no rooms ready but to check around 1 pm. After waiting for about two hours, around noon, I asked at front desk if they had any rooms ready and the man there gave me the good news that there actually was a room available on the 6th floor.

Location- They are located right off of Times Square a perfect balance of not in the mix of the crowds and noise but easy to get to the crowds and noise. We heard no noise from our room and slept wonderfully. Staff- Front Desk staff were great and so was housekeeping. We actually had our room down graded due to overbooking from a wedding and the Manager was very accommodating and apologetic he allowed us to check in early/offered us late check out/ and got us some appetizers and drinks from their overly popular rooftop restaurant-the haven.

It must be said that Jimmy, the Concierge, is the heart and soul of Sanctuary and the staff makes every effort to live up to his standards. He even recognized us after so many years. Even though it is undergoing renovation and therefore does not have a restaurant, at a time chosen by us, a 'breakfast box' arrived. In each box was coffee, juice, yogurt, an apple and a croissant.

Any request made was promptly met with a smile and courteousness. Thank you Sanctuary Team! Covid did make things a little less traditional: breakfast to rooms was just okay and daily cleaning of rooms didn't happen automatically. But I for one appreciate the times and totally understand and everyone else should as well. For those saying the rooms are small I recommend getting a Deluxe Room. It's plenty big.

So the next day I had no breakfast and was not even offered coffee or anything. For my second night, I was sure to place my order in advance.

Breakfast was delivered to the room, but they forgot so i had to call the front desk, they only had coffee, some stale muffin and yougurt.

The hotel feels very sexy so it was perfect for our little staycation. We're right next to Times Square so we got to be tourist in our city. The rooftop is gorgeous. We had the king suite overlooking the street with wall to wall windows. It was a great change and escape from our tiny Brooklyn apartment.

We travelled from London for a 5night stay booking through Virgin for essentially a sightseeing city escape. Starting off with the good the staff were always polite, any problem we had or anything we asked was never a problem. The hotel is located central New York, alot of the typical sightseeing attractions are in walking distance. It's also bed and breakfast so being able to wake up and not worry about your first meal is nice. The room was also always kept nice clean and tidy.

The elevator is small and slow, which if you cant handle that, take the steps. We did. The roof top bar on this hotel, Haven, was very cute and nice to hang out in. The hotel was clean, but hallway noise was very loud in the rooms. We have been to many nice hotels but in NY city we dont have much experience and expect most places are more compact.

The staff was wonderful, just incredibly helpful and friendly. T The breakfast buffet was a nice to have, but nothing to write home about, I would probably go to a legit bakery or something next time. The rooftop bar was very pretty, but the drink prices are redic. My boyfriend got a mixed drink that was all ice and probably had a total of 2 ounces of liquid for 20 bucks, not worth it.

The rooms were tastefully decorated, the staff very nice, and the included breakfast very good (although it's a bit cheap to charge extra for espresso!). You won't get views of Times Square here like at the nearby Marriott, but then you won't get the price either. The hotel has dimly lit common areas and a swanky vibe that made our middle-aged selves laugh.

Being in New York at Christmas has always been on our bucket list and we got to tick it off this year. The sanctuary hotel was beautiful and in the best location if you want to stay in the hustle and bustle of the city. Loved the fact it was close to Central made even better for those cold morning winter walks. The staff were very friendly and the food in all of the restaurants were amazing. I would highly recommend the sushi!! We also spent New Years in the haven rooftop bar which was a lovely finish to our holiday. I would highly recommend this hotel.,

"132 West 47TH Street, New York City, NY 10036",Sanctuary Hotel New York,Had a staycation to just relax for a couple days and glad we chose this hotel. A real hidden gem in Times Square (which as a real New Yorker you’d always avoid this area). Room is small but pretty standard do NY but the hotel makes great use of the space. Buffet breakfast was also pretty good and don’t skip the rooftop(open in the winter but covered) with good music and eats. No gym but off passes to a gym within walking distance that I didn’t visit since it wasn’t close enough during a very cold winter morning. Would recommend staying.,

We especially enjoyed the fresh water provided every morning, and me and my partner still speak of the beautiful fragrance that inhabits the lobby (wish we knew what it was!).

The pictures of the roof top look really amazing on their website but it is completely different in person it's a full bar and not kid friendly all the plans of relaxing on the roof top that i imagined were ruined.

To say the rooms are small is an understatement!. I barely had room for my suitcase. I am a seasoned traveler, so I don't need/use a large suitcase for a 5 night stay. I queen bed (platform style), a small desk, mini bar and out-dated television on the wall (not your modern day flat screen) are the only items in the room....very small space to walk and closet was about the width of my suitcase standing up.

I tend to like the boutique hotels. In this case the room was very expensive, even by NY standards. It was the smallest room I have had, outside of Asia. No room for a desk or chair, the bathroom directly adjacent the bed and looking out to a brick wall in a light well. I could almost touch the shower from the bed. The decor is unusual and noir. I’m sure it’s trendy but I didn’t really like it. Great location and the people were super helpful. I can see my reviews differ from others, but I’m probably back to my regular spots next time.",

Staff friendly and helpful from the moment my taxi dropped me off until I left for the airport. 2. Hotel appears to have been recently updated, with modern shower and decor furnishings throughout. The entire hotel has a nice fresh (but not overpowering) smell. 3. Convenient location -- theatre district , times square, shopping 4.

The 'breakfast' was disgraceful. Served in the same, back-to-the-nineties bar. My wife had to spread a napkin out on the chair before she sat down. It was disgusting. There were no options for anyone with any ideas of healthy eating. Porridge? No. Muesli? No. Yoghurt, granola, bran? That would be a no. Eggs? Yes! Tepid scrambled eggs. Other varities?

Breakfast included and fine to start the day, serves from 07:00 which suited us. The real plus of this hotel is the staff, especially the door men who are always on hand, Gil the STAR manager was great and booked the 9/11 museum on our behalf. We were celebrating our 30th Wedding Anniversary which was overlooked by the hotel but not an issue.

Our room was pocket-sized ,with a view of a concrete wall, and with a curtained-off shower. Noise from the air conditioning and the roof bar above was a constant intrusion. The hotel seems to set great store by the decor, which we found weird. Dark and gloomy, mirrors on the ceiling (sadly no pink champagne on ice), unpleasant odours in the passageways. The sports bar's walls are lined with huge TVs, all showing different channels to a background of thumping rock music. If you are party people then this is for you.

Even the handle to the door of the hotel was greasy to the touch. The air conditioning was very noisy, especially noticeable when trying to sleep. I wasn’t impressed by the hotel’s rooftop restaurant - it was overrun by non-hotel guests, very noisy and frenetic. That’s fine…", 
"132 West 47TH Street, New York City, NY 10036",Sanctuary Hotel New York,"We spent 7 nights here in July. The porters were excellent, as was the team of concierges. The room we had booked was unavailable due to a 'plumbing problem', so we were upgraded to a King room on arrival. Disappointing to then have to pack up and relocate the next day to a queen room, so we couldn't really settle in until day 2 of our stay. The room was tiny, but to be honest we only slept there. The air con blew directly onto the bed on one side and was extremely noisy. The continental breakfast was exactly the same every day. The roof top bar was fabulous. But what a location!! So easy to access and was a haven among the bustle of Times Square",

"132 West 47TH Street, New York City, NY 10036",Sanctuary Hotel New York,"I really want to like this hotel. It is in a great location, one block outside of Times Square. Unfortunately, the rooms are the tiniest that I have stayed in while in New York City, and there is only a tiny window with no light. The redeeming qualities of this hotel are the rooftop bar, and good service from the people who work there. The hotel itself has a very cool zen vibe, but it is a shame it is so dark and small. The bathroom is actually part of the room, with only a curtain to separate the bedroom from the bathroom. They do offer complimentary water downstairs during the day and complimentary coffee in the morning. Overall, despite the cute atmosphere, I would not recommend staying at this hotel.",

If you want to be right in the heart of Midtown I can't imagine a better hotel at a better price. I was blown away by the luxury hotel feel when I walked into the lobby and was greeted so warmly by the reception staff - hot tea? yes please. hot towel? yes absolutely. It is NYC so the rooms aren't large, but they're perfectly fine for getting a good night's sleep, a warm shower, and for any downtime you might want while breaking from business or tourism or whatever you're doing that day. Oh! And the rooftop bar is awesome. It is definitely a fun scene to be a part of and as hotel guests, you get to skip the line that will eventually form.

The staff are very friendly, helpful as we asked many times for some recommendations where to eat and professional. The rooftop bar is great when it's not busy, I am not sure if they have a maximum amount of people allowed up there but if they don't i think they should take this into consideration. Only had breakfast one morning but it was standard continental so cereals, toast, pastries, fruit, yogurt, tea/coffee and juice. The hotel overall is OK, I was possibly expecting too much.

The reception staff were all very good and friendly but those on the rooftop bar were an exception, who seem to cater for private parties and non residents. The hotel is very dark and crypt like everywhere and wouldn’t be good for older guests. Our room was tiny; one of the worst we have ever stayed in. The air con is very loud and hard to sleep with when it’s on. There was a separate toilet but the shower and basin are behind a curtain. The wardrobe space is suitable for 6 items or so as it’s also tiny so we couldn’t unpack our cases at all. The breakfast was just about ok as were staff.

This was our first time in New York. The check in was swift and efficient and our bags were quickly delivered to our room which was positioned to the front overlooking 47th street. We were lucky enough to have received an upgrade to a deluxe room which was a large room with a comfortable king sized bed and twin sinks and an excellent shower. The breakfast was included in the price and consisted of a buffet where you could help yourself to cereals, fruit, pastries, hot food, juice and tea or coffee.

We liked the text message system with housekeeping, and used it to ask for extra hangers and robes, it was very efficient! Our room was tiny-405 and more an in suite than en suite but it was clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. We had no view but it was very quiet. The air con was difficult to get right though and quite noisy. We ate once at the rooftop restaurant, it was pleasant, and so was Tenders downstairs. The bar downstairs was pretty busy but again the staff were friendly. We did think the hotel overall was very dark and the rooftop is very popular with a lively young crowd. The hotel is very convenient for Times Square and Top of the Rock.",

The whole hotel is in darkness, which feels rather oppressive and our room was just horrid. The bed was uncomfortable, there was no separate bathroom, the air con was so loud that we couldn't have it on during the night and the whole room just felt damp. The rooftop bar was also a massive letdown. I haven't been to New York before, so not sure what the overall standard is, but I was disappointed with the Sanctuary.",

From start to end they couldn't have been more helpful (special mention to Danny and Ian the main doormen). we arrived slightly early but had a room ready for us straight away which was great. we entered our room and found a note on the bed saying thanks for spending your anniversary celebration at our hotel, please call us at reception for your complimentary bottle of bubble, again, very thoughtful and just generally a great little touch. there have been a few reviews about it being ""too dark"", which is slightly true,but in my opinion, get over it!!! it adds to the ambience, and the hotel looks great. the rooftop bar is great, very attentive staff and just a good vibe! location couldn't be better! time square a 30 second walk…",

Breakfast was included and was pretty good. They also have a sushi restaurant in the hotel but didn't get to try it out. Overall good experience, only wish they didn't impose so many taxes and fees (amounted to 50$ by itself). Check out is at 12pm.",

We were looking for a place near the theatre (5 min. walk to William Kerr Theatre and Hadestown!). Yes, the rooms are small as noted in other reviews but super comfortable bed, and come on folks, how much time do you spend in your hotel room in NYC? We did the Park & Stay package and I was disappointed that there was no valet parking and I had to get back in the car and battle traffic again to get to the garage after a six hour drive. The roof top bar seems to be an attraction and is noisy and people seemed to be way overindulging. But hey, maybe I’m just too old!

The hotel is in a great location just off Times Square.

A bonus was the breakfast which yes, is the same and limited but again satisfactory. Unfortunately the rooftop bar was always far to crowded and not the most pleasant of views so we only went there once but the cocktails that we had were very nice. The ony reason I have given 4/5 and not 5/5 is due to when we left. At soon as we got to the hotel we asked (based on other reviews) whether we would be…",

The location is second to none and it’s very handy having a beverage station in the lobby to grab a coffee to go. It has a few restaurants within the hotel and a rooftop bar where we dined on our last night and I’d very much recommend. Our room was small which is usual for NYC and had no view but as we were only ever there to bathe and sleep I don’t see this as a problem (room 609). I personally loved the open plan bathroom too.

They moved us to room 708 - larger a normal sized room for NYC with a functional window. Unfortunately it has an awful mold/musty smell that went away after about 20 minutes with the window open.

The housekeeping staff was immediately helpful when I reported a bad bathroom light bulb and the front desk staff was professional and helpful. I will definitely look to book here again!

Each interaction with the superb staff felt personal and the staff were fully invested in us having a great time. I'd single out the following staff for exceptional service: Concierge (and Clef D'Or holder) - Muzaffar - he went the extra mile to help us book our night safari Pool-side manager - Maurice (one of the nicest Aussie's I've met) Pool life guard - Mo ( a one in a million character)",

There doesn't seem to be anyone to help you navigate the madness of so many people so even though as a hotel guest spending a lot of money it doesn't feel like you are important to the hotel.

We had young adults with us - who asked at the pool area, about the music venue, on this floor (of which we could have booked, but was told the night club might suit them better), so didnt book, when they went to the nightclub, it was shut - they went back to floor 57 (i think it was 57), to be told oh sorry - yes i gave you thee wrong info - but then wouldn't let them as it was full, and they didnt book - although advised not to.

We booked for 3 nights stay to a premium room. Everything was planned perfectly until we arrived in the hotel. There was a flocked of people everywhere, we don’t have any idea what was going on upon entering the door. We approached a gentleman wearing a black suit that we wanted to checked in and we found out that we could not check in because the hotel was having a system down. My husband and I wanted to melt down coming from a long flight only to found out that we could not get our room upon arriving the hotel. It was around half past 3 o clock when we arrived.

"10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956 Singapore",Marina Bay Sands,"I visited Marina Bay for 2 nights on our way to Bali. Lots to share to help everyone make their decision if this is the place to stay in Singapore (we believe it is.) Food - visited Spago and Cest la vie bar. Be clear when you book Spago if you want the fine dining as we made this mistake and we couldn’t then get a reservation at the fine dining as it was fully booked and they have a strict dress code so my boyfriend in shorts and a shirt wouldn’t have been allowed in anyway. The food was okay but we didn’t get to experience the fine dining which I’m sure would be out of this world. Pool - way more impressive by night than by day. I love that there are different chill spaces like day beds, cabanas, sun beds etc… and that the pool and jacuzzis are open until 11pm at night. The…",

The staff were all very friendly and attentive, Nicholas who checked us in was excellent, he was so helpful and made sure we knew everything about the hotel that we needed to. Candy in the gift shop was also wonderful, so friendly and helpful. The pool is an awesome experience, as it wasn't peak season we got to go a few times.

Was £1000 for one night, and not worth it. I had dirty bedding which had to be changed. We couldn’t get into any of the roof top bars which I think as we were a hotel guest for one night we should have been Abel to. That was very disappointing. The room wasn’t wow, which for that amount of money was also very disappointing. We spent most of our time at the infinity sky pool which was amazing but the only amazing thing of our stay. Had this been half the price perhaps I would have been more wowed but it’s defo not worth the money of the stay! I had paid half the price of this for hotels which have been outstanding.",

Every morning we woke up at 5:50 am to have the pool all to ourselves. At 6:50 my companion would leave the pool and head down to the Cafe ORIGIN + BLOOM. The coffee is great. But without fail, my companion, Maria, would return with our coffee saying how nice Linda at the front counter was to her. This happened every morning. Linda remembered our orders and always had a warm smile. So yeah, the hotel is amazing but always remember, its the people working there that makes it so.",

The customer service is very poor, which will take you by surprise compared to other 5 star luxury hotels. Check-in process is long and there isn’t proper sitting/waiting area.

The hotel is very expensive - $8.00 for a coke - $18.00 for a Heineken - $55.00 each for breakfast - dinner buffet in excess of $100 each We tried to book restaurants on the 57th floor - there are 4 - I think - every restaurant was booked out for dinner - for the next 3 nights of our stay I think 1 restaurant offered a table at 10.00pm !! I suggested to the hotel that guests paying nearly $900 a night - should be advised to book the restaurants in advance of their stay so they are not disappointed.

"10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956 Singapore",Marina Bay Sands,"The service at the hotel was great and attentive; I had a wonderful welcome gift from the hotel. However, at the price of almost $1000 dollars a night that should be pretty standard. The pool was wonderful to experience and it is great that there was no time limit. It was not crowded at all and enjoyed the pool as well as the hot tubs overlooking the ships.

We were a honeymoon couple but they weren’t bothered by that. We choose this hotel thinking it would be the best in Singapore but were left feeling a bit deflated. A lot more work is needed in making guests feel like they are in-fact staying in the best hotel in Singapore. Disappointing to find we had to pay a $400 holding fee which was not advertised and some 17 days later, we are still awaiting this refund - I don’t understand how they are able to hold on to your money for that long after check out??",

The luggage magically came to the room and left the room without us needing to supervise, thanks to the very able luggage staff and the exceptional operational management. It is worth staying in the suites for this premiere experience.

Pool and sky bar are lovely but we were refused entry before leaving for the airport at 5pm were told all tables were booked in spite of it being empty. We were given a bar stool seat and the restaurant remained empty till we left.

"10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956 Singapore",Marina Bay Sands,"Stayed at MBS for the first time and was disappointed at the long checkin lines, crowded infinity pool, and overall retail atmosphere of the hotel. All restaurants were overbooked and reservations had to be made months in advance. After spending more than $1000 on integrated resort purchases we were told that our loyalty points would expire in 12 months with no option to redeem destination dollars online. Our Prestige status would also be downgraded if we did not continue to spend. This is not how you treat loyal customers! As a tourist, this discourages me from returning to MBS. Very commercialized hotel with poor concern for customers. We also stayed at the Shangri-La during our trip for less than half the price of MBS and the atmosphere was much more refined.",

"10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956 Singapore",Marina Bay Sands,It’s a Disney World. You have to wait for everything. You have to pre-register what time you want to check in. You get a ticket and wait for your number to be called just to check in. The pool is cool. But you get only 1.5h a day and you have to register what time you want to access 24h prior. And it’s nothing relaxing. Full of Instagrammers taking photos and the staffs are constantly asking your room numbers to ensure 1.5h limit. The rooms are okay. Service is okay but nothing personal. Never again.,

Overall, Marina Bay Sands is worth the price of staying there at least once. The infinity pool is almost always open (6am-11pm) and was not crowded at all. During our stay there, we went to the pool as many times as we could and easily found lounge chairs. My only complaint is that the pool is not heated so it can get cold especially in the mornings. The food at the restaurants and the food court was delicious. The hotel is walking distance from one of the hawker centers (Lau Pa Sat) passing the marina into downtown. The metro station and bus stops are right there so taking public transportation was not a problem. We did our own city tour…",

"10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956 Singapore",Marina Bay Sands,Service for check-in was quick. You will need to register before checking in so that you won't have to wait long. Sms will be sent informing you of your Queue number. We stayed at L51 at Tower 3 with City View. The room is huge with two big tv screens. The view is awesome. In the front is the city view that overlooks the water and on the left is the Garden by the bay view. The infinity pool has great views too. A little crowded but we managed to take some great photos. They were short staff but service is still top notch. The night view is best with lights up from Garden of the Bay as well as the city view. There is no time limit to using the pool., 
"10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956 Singapore",Marina Bay Sands,"It seems to be a must do while in the city. Once you get to the top there are great views but like everything else in Singapore (apart from the trains) it is expensive to eat/drink there. As a visitor you need to pay to get to the top platform but are restricted in the areas you can go to unless you are a resident - as in you cannot go to the infinity pool. Cost per person is $22SGD/£13/16USD as of February 2020. The views of the city and shoreline are great, it overlooks the F1 circuit and I would consider it a must do on a visit. If you can afford to stay there you will get much more however as a tourist it should be on your Singapore bucket list. It is also great to wander around the ground and mall on ground level.",

Most of the guests had to stay in the lobby lounge area even after 5 pm and it wasn’t the experience expected after paying $800++ per room per night. However, the reception staff Alice was genuinely concerned about us as we just arrived following a long flight and she noted it was my birthday, she ensured escalating the matter to her manager Lydia who took care of us very well. Both of them ensured that we were taken care of as best as possible while trying to resolve the check in issue beyond their control.

"10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956 Singapore",Marina Bay Sands,I travelled with my best friend to Singapore in July for a week and we decided to spoil ourselves and stay at the beautiful Marina Bay Sands hotel. On the 57th floor was the ICONIC infinity pool that had the most amazing views. During our stay we met the very entertaining lifeguard Moe. He honestly made our stay so much fun. Moe was there every day to greet us with a smile and fluff our sun bed pillows 😂 We would joke and livestream so all our family and friends would join in the fun and Moe became the face of our social media lives and so he got the name ICON MOE of MBS 🤩 If you are looking for a great time away with 10 ⭐️ service Moe will give you a fun holiday to remember. All our family and friends can’t wait to meet Moe 😍,

We were early so took a look around the shoppes shopping mall and was then called when our room was ready. Our main contact Mac took us to the room and we were blown away by the views and standard of the room. We then visited the infinity pool which was incredible.

At sunset is very crowded and in my opinion it is even more impressive in the dark and there is not much going on. From the rooms I was unfortunately a little disappointed, you pay the high price only for the pool, the rest of the hotel is below the renowned 5 star competition. The associated shopping center is also spectacular and one of the largest I have ever seen. Small travel hack in the in-house casino you get drinks, cigarettes and more for free.",

He instantly made sure we had everything we needed, helped take pictures of us and was so helpful in giving us information about the area.

The view from the room was amazing - and even more breathtaking from the infinity pool! I recommend that you book your restaurants well in advance of your vacation. Sadly most of the restaurants at the hotel were fully booked for the duration of our stay, which didn’t leave many options for us. Room service took a very long time, which is understandable given the size of the hotel. We appreciated the chocolates offered to us by the hotel, as a gift for our honeymoon. We were very impressed with the housekeeping staff who did an amazing job. The hotel is in walking distance of the Gardens on the Bay, which is a great activity for tourists.

The views are outstanding and the location is very impressive. Tonnes of overpriced designer stores, and a relatively close food court and other good eating options nearby, seemingly for the Mainland Chinese visitors, good access for MRT and Taxis are almost non stop. The rooms were large and very comfortable, we all loved the automatic curtains and the large bathrooms. The Gardens by the bay are a great experience with the shuttle if the idea of a walk in 28c doesn't appeal to you. The nearby Art and Science museum was an unexpectedly fun trip and worth the visit if you have kids or a curious nature. Its so large its almost tiring to walk around and the lifts make it a bit complex…", 
"10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956 Singapore",Marina Bay Sands,"I’m staying at the hotel at the moment and I wanted to give my initial impressions. The check-in process as well as booking to use the infinity pool are a bit quirky. Both require registration within 24 hours of arrival but the system was down when I tried and the backup mobile number also did not work. Slightly unusually, the reservations team does not seem to be as accessible as in other hotels (a bit slow). Prior to arrival, you are certainly left feeling that you have booked at a five-star hotel, but you are not being treated as an essential customer. Upon arrival, we had a short wait during our registered check-in period but once all the paperwork had been completed (took longer than checking in at other hotels) we were left to our room and started enjoying the premises. …",

"10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956 Singapore",Marina Bay Sands,"First time here, blown away by what I saw, suppose the moon would be the same but after 10 mins you see it for what it is. Casino, nightmare to even enter and the staff are like tailors dummies, no personality or wit. Room service eh had to wait 30 mins for them to call me back...didn't so I kept calling back. Told me to order a Grab if I needed quick service. Basically nice for one night then take a few months to get over the cash you gave them and hopefully after 10 years you only remember the good bit", 
"10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956 Singapore",Marina Bay Sands,"Massive place crossed between Las Vegas and Disney, hard to get any personal service it’s crazy busy, the pool is stunning but manic and not relaxing at all it’s busy, noisy, all laid out in long lines with most people saving beds and not using them. Queues at every restaurant from early morning to late at night. It’s an exhausting experience. Concierge are so very helpful they really do make a difference. Rooms are pretty basic at most levels, views over bay are nice and interesting. Garden views are cool for the light show every night.", 
"10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956 Singapore",Marina Bay Sands,"It’s big, it’s brash and it’s beautiful. We stayed on the 51st floor for a couple of nights and the room and views were superb. We didn’t use a huge amount of the hotel amenities but the infinity pool is spectacular and well worth staying at the hotel for. Transfer from Changi is quick by taxi and pretty reasonably priced and would recommend as a low stress option. The hotel isn’t cheap by any means but it’s quite an experience, certainly one we won’t forget.", 
"10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956 Singapore",Marina Bay Sands,"Stayed one night in transit thru Singapore. Management team upgraded us to an Orchid suite due to problem with our reservation. Also we found a cake waiting in our room to help us celebrate our anniversary. Very thoughtful! The room was spectacular with a wide view of the marina from a high floor. We waited about 30 minutes for our check in opportunity. We used the infinity pool deck and enjoyed our time there watching the sunset, and had some drinks and appetizers. The pool deck servers were very professional and efficient. It was a great stay, just too short. Thanks to the staff of the MBS!",

"10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956 Singapore",Marina Bay Sands,"We stayed a night in a garden view deluxe room and found it amazing. This is not a hotel, it is a resort with more than 2500 rooms. Still, check in was rather effektive. (They use a lot of time everywhere in Singapore). Rooms were great with good amenties and great views of the gardens and the supertree grove. We spent an intire day first row in the world renowned infinity pool. To be honest - this is why we booked a room here. One thing we did not understand is why the signage told that children had to be above 13 yrs to enter, but a lot of 7-8-9 yr old still splashed around, ruining the experience for other guests. Why??? Still - it was an amazing experience and is highly recommended :)", 
"10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956 Singapore",Marina Bay Sands,Beautiful property with unbelievable customer service. The rooftop infinity pool is an absolute must do.

This hotel, it’s rooms, the staff - everything is simply first class there are no words to describe the pure luxury of the entire package. We upgraded to the club room which was worth every single penny (the food and drink selection along then the amazingly friendly staff (I wish I could remember her name)). We came for my husband’s 50th which included Malaysia my only regret is we should have skilled Malaysia and stayed at Marina Bay longer.",

After lugging our luggage to our allocated room, we headed for the pool without much of an expectation from the staff. Upon our arrival at the pool, we were pleasantly greeted by a Mr Moe, the lifeguard. He was such a jewel who changed our perspective of the hotel. Mr Moe was pro-active in everything he did. He ensured not only me and my son, but everyone at the pool were well taken care of and had a good time.

The rooms were exquisite, and the views from Spago and the pool on level 57 were spectacular. Whilst our check in process was very slow (took almost 50 minutes), the staff were apologetic and recovered somewhat by sending cake to both of our rooms as a gesture. We dined at Spago Pool side on the Friday, where we shared a few starter dishes, and then dined at Lavo on the Saturday - WOW! The hotel rooms are beautiful, and the bathroom was amazing, double basin, shower and bath. Very spacious room with amazing views overlooking the gardens.

We then went to check in and as we waited in the queue for too long (all of 5 mins) they fast tracked us to another counter and upgraded our room to a higher floor for the inconvenience. We didn’t even complain but it was a lovely gesture. We then got to our room to find our luggage already there soon after a knock at the door with a lady wishing me happy birthday and handing over some cake which was a lovely touch!

Arriving at 1.30am we were quickly checked in and upgraded to a magnificent room than was more than enough for the 3 of us overlooking garden by the bay. We loved having a balcony to have fresh air in the evening. On leaving our room to explore the amazing breakfast we were asked if our room could be cleaned ( at 9am !!!) and this continued throughout our stay . It was terrific to have the room sorted so early . All staff we encountered went out of their way to be approachable and helpful. The pool was just as…,

He is definitely a valuable asset to MBS. Keep up the good work Ryan!. Thumbs up!",

We are aware that taking photos is not Moe’s main duty in his workplace but he was so great in offering to take our photos! better than selfies😁. For Moe , he set an example of giving his best to make guests feel welcome and belonging regardless of an individual’s race, colour and status.

After getting checked in we got to our room and settled in.

Not to mention just how amazing the property itself is. A definite must see.,

We stayed in Deluxe Room with a sky view located on the 45th floor. Our room was generous in size, was equipped with all of the facilities you require and the view was absolutely amazing, in my opinion well worth the extra money when compared to a lower floor view. The hotel's infinitely pool provides breathtaking entertainment to everybody, regardless of their age. The hotel is connected to a shopping centre that offers a casino, high end shopping and an endless amount of food options. Marina Bay Sands is highly recommended!",

Spago by Wolfgang Puck offers refinement, a rich menu with excellent choices and a wine list so impressive; that we struggled to choose.

"10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956 Singapore",Marina Bay Sands,"As expected everything about marina bay sands is grand including its prices! Considering the high price you pay to stay there, customer service is patchy and inconsistent (from very good service most of the time to less than mediocre service some of the time). Security in accessing the Casino is more heightened (a little overkill) than immigration security at the airport! The infinity pool was nice and free ice cream was a plus (despite the pool being crowded due to school holidays). The free light show at the marina was spectacular (truly immersive and breathtaking). The floating apple store nearby was fun. If you can stay there without breaking the bank it’s worth it. The hotel room was nicely stocked and comfortable!",

Make sure you scan it everytime you go shopping or dine in. The rewards are well worth it. At the Infinity Pool we had Moe play photographer (his one of the many lifesavers).

If you want to save money, go through Booking.com, but the rooms you’ll get will be the lower floors and least desirable. If you book directly with the hotel, you may get the better rooms. I would double check both sites first to compare the rates before you book. Now, let’s talk about the hotel. It’s iconic and the most beautiful hotel in the city. The location is unbeatable. You can literally spend a week there if you could afford it. There’s three main towers connected by a long lobby on the bottom and the infinity pool on top.

We used Club 55 which is definitely worth the upgrade and never had any lunch as we were so full up with afternoon tea and evening drinks.

We had 2 rooms, one on 21st floor and one on 48th floor and both had the harbour view. I would totally recommend them over the city view rooms. Not only I think that the garden/harbour view is simply nicer but also because they have balconies which is amazing in the evenings as you can look at the many ships and the gardens by the bay. The lower floor room had a really big balcony and a super close view of the light and music show in the gardens. The upper floor room had a small balcony so could only stand there or alternatively sit in the room with the doors open. Both were great for different reasons.

The room size is also good for the price you pay. This is the first hotel i have experienced where even kids had their individual key card. Kids felt special when they got their own key cards. the sofa cum bed dint have the best comfort, but was ok. they should have provided with a little more thicker beds. We would feel the springs in the sofa cum beds. The main beds were very comfortable. No complains there.",

The pools view is as spectacular as you see in photos, BUT what they don’t show you is how crowded it actually is with screaming splashing children alllllll over (not just in the children’s pool) .

The rest of the staff from housekeeping to operators to gym/pool staff are thankfully as pleasant as the porter The room is ok sized with a generous balcony and 50-60 inch flat screen tv. The bed is disapponting - not king sized nor luxurious. Towels too, are worn and cheap feeling.

"10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956 Singapore",Marina Bay Sands,"The hotel is beautiful and the infinity pool is incredible! It’s a real flaw that you can only access the pool from tower 3 and not the other 2 towers. Staff were excellent throughout except for at breakfast. Breakfast service in the Rise was extremely poor. We had to wait 15-20 minutes in large queues, even when there were empty tables that were simply not being cleaned. In a hotel that prides itself on efficiency, this was very poor. Even getting water at breakfast was bad as the lady “serving” kept running out of glasses and took ages to get new ones. One elderly guest even resorted to bringing a bowl to get water as they needed some to take their medication! Overall the hotel and service was excellent but breakfast service was utterly terrible and needs to be sorted.",

Pool and bar staff are amazing. Special shout out to Maurice, Mary & Ryan. Location is also close to so many attractions and food options. Only small criticism we have is the breakfast in Spago. The manger should take a trip to W @ Sentosa to see how a breakfast should be done. Having said that it didn’t affect our stay and we loved every minute of our time here and will be back for sure.

Staff are outstanding. Facility is beautiful- beyond words. Infinity pool awesome- no longer any limits on time you can spend at the pool.

Yet, the lobby is like a train station, busy noisy, friendly yet very nusy staff. Breakfast isn't recommended, but Chinese lunch was ok to good. The pool and view terrace on top of the iconic building is a bit over regulated. Certain areas couldn't be accessed for picturing (alneit bekng empty) and it was entirely clear why the staff follows such procedures. Rooms are good but a bit dated. Gym is great, good views, and friendly staff. I wouldn't want to stay there and rather pick other places.",

Definitely the best hotel in Singapore!", 
"10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956 Singapore",Marina Bay Sands,"This is purely about their room service. It took 5 mins for them to respond and they informed us that they had wait times of over an hour. This is ridiculous for a 5 star hotel that I am paying nearly SGD2000. Unheard of anywhere else in the world, but in Singapore, all they say is suck it. I am still here.",

The water is good, the service is perfect, they have people serving refreshments along the pool sides at no extra cost. The rooms are luxurious with perfect services for in room dining as well. Particularly Mr. Sean had taken care that my 3 year old baby is also served well. Brought some in house chocolates for her along with my beer tasting bucket. They extended our check out till 2 PM.

The team was nice enough to provide us with an early check-in. The service was pretty quick as our luggage had reached the room before us and the extra bed was placed within 5 minutes of that. The pool is obviously amazing at any point of time and they have amazing hot tubs as well. The drinks in the pool are not that costly. Sling or pina colada costs SGD 25-26 (inclusive of taxes).

Would I stay their again knowing what I know now about the resort? Yes. We had a Deluxe King Sky View. It had great views of the city and skyline. The only reason we stayed at the hot was for access to the roof top infinity pool. It it wasn’t for the pool I would not stay at the hotel. It doesn’t feel like you are staying in a hotel. It feels like you are staying in a mall. The hotel is big and impersonal. The pool is great. Amazing views of the city.

We would all line up in the heat and some people couldn’t get the thing to work. Not the best when youve been dying to visit the most iconic pool in the world. We couldn’t get a drink and swim because there are only certain times for that. So had to plan accordingly. Whatever happened to pool side service? I literally only stayed for the pool. The casino was a nightmare. No drinks in sight. That’s changed. You can’t even get a water. One night I went downstairs at 10pm to visit 7/11 and was stopped by security. “CLOSED” but was told by staff it’s open. Hotel check in took forever be aware of this as it eats into pool and dinner time. Checkout is a breeze with the card drop.…,

Within an hour we had not 1 but 2 calls to say that the room was ready and we could collect our room key. Once we collected our room key we headed to the lifts, and followed the bell hop into the lift with our luggage. Later that day we received a note apologising that the luggage was not in the room before we got there. Wherever you went in the hotel help was on hand if you needed.

The hotel rooms are big, but the quality is average, and the bathroom could be much better (e.g. rain shower & bath). The Infinity Pool is great, though obviously you have book a slot in advance.

Moe was also very helpful and happy to assist all the time with a huge smile plastered on his face.

Checkin process is a efficient as they had virtual queue in which you put down your name and number then it will notify you once you're ready to be served (so you are able to browse around or sit down somewhere nearby without standing in line). We didn't have a SG number so we were standing infant of the numbering machine waiting.

I will like to give acknowledgement to Alan. I was due to check in on friday and I went down to the hotel on Thursday to make plans with the team. Alan made sure to keep the large bouquet of roses I bought were safe. He even went the extra step to find a place where it could be stored in the fridge for me.

The check-in process was a breeze, and I was only at the front desk for less than 7 minutes when I was handed my key; and off I went. Being an avid cyclist, the fact that I could store my bicycle was a definite plus! What struck me the most as I entered the room was the enormity of it. The hotel did not stinge on space for their rooms. My room was well maintained, with guest amenities aplenty. I would have liked for a bottle of mouthwash though, and one or two of the electrical sockets did not seem to work well. I had to press down my phone changer plug to get it connected.

Just in from Australia, we were in Rise for breakfast at 7am - no queues. We also visited the infinity pool at 9am rather than one of the busier parts of the day. Yes it can be busy but you can plan around it. The downside that you can't plan around, is the behaviour of other guests. On a Saturday night, the hotel is 'party central' with people coming back from other venues and 'kicking on' in their rooms.

Staff- perhaps due to covid, bad management or lack of care the staff are generally quite rude. Particularly the staff at the pool area. It’s closer to an asylum rather than a pool. From being greeted with “are you going to your room’ rather than a hello or good morning.

I booked a Club Harbour Room for a National Day stay. It was expectedly busy due the public holiday and National Day celebrations. There wasn't an rooms for upgrade as well due to the peak crowd and a late check-out was offered as per membership benefit entitlements. If you are holding a GHA Discovery status, the benefits and service ends there, this pales in comparison to IHG or Marriott Bonvoy. For a flagship Pan-Pacific property, I find this rather disappointing. The room was generally good, measuring about 38 sqm. There is a very good working chair with back support that would be ideal for working in the room with multiple plugs for your electronics at the work desk. Although, the lack of…",

I also like the fact that the hotel showers had big bottles of shampoo, shower gel and conditioner installed, as this reduces the amount of plastic waste from the small disposable bottles.. this is the best thing for an environmentally conscious hotel.. The hotel buffet had a wide variety of different cuisines and the room service was good as well..

The oriental club was excellent and staff great - Samantha was the stand out. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will be my firs pick on returning to Singapore. The beds and bedding were probable the best I have experienced.,

While we were there the army was practicing for the country’s 50th anniversary. We saw military jets flying low, in formation, as well as tanks cruising the streets.

Everything was in order so I had no troubles. Only the breakfast is bit on the steep side at SGD 54. Not worth it. Did not have any other meals at the hotel so cannot comment on the food.

The breakfast here is quite amazing.We had a Marina Bay view room and it is well worth the extra cost.Very central location for exploring all Singapore has to offer.A bit disappointing that you have to pay for Wifi.",

Although the hotel have given me a wrong room at first, but the staff immediately change and upgrade me to a twin bed room. The reception staff irene even led us to the room which i was surprised. The tv at the hall was down but the technician jimmy went down few times to get a nice cable box to refix it. Lastly i am just disappointed about the bathtub as a suite room the bathtub should be bigger than i expected but instead it was very small. On top of that the hp chargers are still the old struture fix at walls which was pretty inconvenient for me.", 
"5 Raffles Avenue Marina Square, Singapore 039797 Singapore","Mandarin Oriental, Singapore","Wow what an experience in one of the best hotels in the world, if you are considering the Mandarin for your stay, do it!! We had a club room which the lounge was perfect pre dinner, location excellent ++ just down the road is the hop on bus to give a full tour of Singapore. Singapore is expensive but if you like to eat with the crowd there is an outside food mall opposite the hotel that is buzzing with customers. The breakfast in the hotel is amazing, caters for every culinary taste, the rooms are wondeful, bed really comfortable and the shower gel etc is spa products. This was a real treat to stay here and would without a doubt recommend the hotel for all of the above and also the very happy friendly staff.

The hotel has a vintage look about it and very oriental. The view is the centerpiece of the room and as it was national day weekend in Singapore offered the best view of the fireworks we have ever seen. We had room service for dinner and enjoyed a great view of the celebrations. The swimming pool is large and a great place to swim and watch people. We tried the Japanese restaurant which also had a good view of the Bay. Staff were extremely polite and helpful and service was top class. We are generally impressed and would certainly go back with the appropriate excuse,

My disappointments center around three things; 1) Poor service- It took an 55 minutes to get ice in my room the second night I was there & 35 minutes the first night. I had to ask for coffee 3 times at breakfast the first morning and finally got it just before we needed to leave. 2) Begrudging service- When the bell hop delivered my bags the first night, he looked at my $5 Sing tip as if it was an insult and held his hand out. When the waiter delivered my SGD $28 Caesar salad he was also insulted that I felt the service charge on the bill was enough.

The rooms are spacious and very clean and the service is simply amazing. Absolutely loved the pool area and the food options within the hotel are excellent. My only criticism of this place would be the bathroom. If you're on your own it would be fine but sharing as a couple could get awkward given there is no bathroom door and all-glass bathroom walls which obviously doesn't provide much privacy when using the toilet.,

We walked past the entrance to this hotel and there was a sign out the front saying that the hotel was accessible to guests only. Fair enough, I thought, but we decided to check with staff if we could dine there. They were poised and unfailingly polite, to me as well as the many others who made endless enquires on what would have been one of the busiest nights Marina Bay had seen in a long time.

It is an incredible hotel but is primarily set up for the business traveller. The plus points are the service, the incredible breakfast, all mod cons in the room with a fantastic sound system and the location. I resented paying for wifi. There was no tables and chairs on the balcony so really pointless and the pool only has the sun for a window around 11-3 (probably just the time of year we went though), but saying that the pool is amazing.

We also ate at the japanese restaurant which had very good food although a little atmosphereless. As with most paces it seems in S E Asia, the service was faultless everytime. WiFi was not free!

Service here is top notch and everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Location is great. You are close to the city, but also you have access to Marina Square and Suntec so there are many shopping and food choices. The pool in my opinion is the best one in Singapore. My kids love it and it is very relaxing and peaceful. I would suggest to try to get a cabana if possible. It has a ceiling fan and a dock to listen to your music. The rooms are what you expect from a 5 star,they do not have the wow factor, but function well and have a comfortable bed.

Turn right out of the hotel and you've got a short walk to Boat Quay, Raffles, the Fullerton. Also the hotel is connected by a walkway to the Marina Square shopping complex (and therefore Suntec City behind that) so it's well located for shops.

It was also fairly quiet, despite facing the Marina Bay stage area, and we were able to sleep well.

Enjoyed the beautifully secluded, Hollywood like 5th floor swimming pool which they kept at perfect temperature relative to the outside.

We were so pleasantly surprised with a towel and bottle of water after completing a run around the bay, which is also a must do.

The common areas of the hotel were gorgeous, as one would expect of any Mandarin Oriental. I loved the pool, though it was quite crowded. The rooms, however, felt rather dated, and in dire need of a refresh, especially given the intense competition from so many newer or recently renovated hotels.

The rooms are quite large, but really only accomodate 2 people as the beds are only a king single size or 1 king bed. The suites may have more space for more people, but are more expensive also.

The only negative about the hotel is that you don't want to leave to explore the city! Exceptional service. Nothing is too much trouble. Our room took in the city view and a view of MBS, so you really get the best of both worlds. The Mandarin Oriental chain has never really been on my radar but it certainly is now!",

Reserving a ""club harbour"" room meant check-in handled by a lovely young woman while seated in our hotel room. She then took requests from us and left to make dinner reservations on our behalf.

I won't say where I normally stay when in Singapore or other Asian cities, but for some reason this Mandarin Oriental di'd not quite tick all my boxes. There were some little niggles which just took away the edge - like the two or three set of steps in the Melt café( why do designers put steps around - is it to give the staff something to do or is it to keep the guests alert??), the WC in a gents restroom on the 5th floor where there is no hook at all to hang a jacket whilst in there, towels which are hung up each morning but then are still replaced, and dim sum at breakfast which were only just warm.

We love the Mandarin Oriental hotels due to the excellent service and attention to detail. We stayed in a City Suite with two kids and this worked very well (2 rollaways in the living room). The Harbour suite is amazing (previous stay) but we liked the layout of the city suite as it is slightly bigger in the living area. Buffet breakfast and dinner are amazing with so much choice which really puts Australian hotels to shame. We also tried Mortons Steakhouse and had a great meal there too. We will always stay at Mandarin Oriental properties in Asia.,

One gentleman had one reserved for himself all afternoon despite sitting on them no more than 20 mins, the staff felt reluctant to move his towels and free it up, especially when he disappeared from the pool area for a few hours.

Possible to hold the room until 20h on the day of arrival makes it more flexible for those returning to Europe with the evening flights. Got a very nice room on 12th floor overlooking the beautiful Marina Bay Sands. They have a delicate and large pool area, several fine dining places and a nice bar (Axis Bar and Lounge) with a good view on the forth floor. The breakfast is rather hectic, but they offer a wide selection of breakfast cousins in the Melt World Cafe. Nice spacious bathroom with both shower and bathtub. The beds are heavenly. I needed to get my suit pressed within 45 minutes and they delivered after 30. Brilliant service and this hotel is just what you wish for after a long flight.…",

I would say overall the staff are very helpful and good but I thought the hotel was substandard. First of all it's very dark and gloomy - I was craving natural light all the time. Second, sound proofing in the room was terrible. I could clearly hear TV from next room and also when their phone rang. One crazy thing is that Housekeeping switch on the TV when doing turn down service so one evening all I could hear was the TV playing the ""welcome screen"" to my neighbour. I called to complain and it was resolved quickly but I should not have to hear all this in a luxury hotel. I used the swimming pool on my last day - there was no good changing facilities (I had checked out of my room already). I had to change in a tiny cramped shower room and was…",

This is an excellent hotel, great staff, cleaner than clean, food in the hotel as you would expect is simply amazing whether room service, bar or China valley Cantonese.

"5 Raffles Avenue Marina Square, Singapore 039797 Singapore","Mandarin Oriental, Singapore","Everything about my stay at this hotel was a disappointment. Front desk staff were robotic, there was a long wait to get my room, and when I finally got upstairs, the room was tiny and very worn looking, i.e. only vaguely refreshed 1980s vintage decor. All of this might have been forgiven, but then the drain in the shower was so slow that I had to shower quickly to prevent it from overflowing and a room service meal arrived after a 45 minutes delay and was half wrong. It took another 30 minutes for the 'correct' part of the meal to arrive, and then they forgot the condiments. Given the eye-watering prices this place charges, it should be much, much, much better, and as I said, this experience will make me honestly leary of staying in a Mandarin Oriental hotel again.",

The breakfasts in the Club room were impressive in both their range and their quality again the staff were attentive without being too obtrusive. Try the pool and terrace are if you get time it is hugely attractive open and looks a great place to relax (we were too rushed and found it too late in the day to enjoy it ourselves) I am sure we will return here and certainly it will be our first choice in Singapore.,

The room was furnished in light wood and had basic furnishings: couches, coffee table, lamps. I thought the Grand Hyatt suite was more impressive. Service was of a very high standard and that is where we thought it beat the Grand Hyatt. Nothing was too much for the staff.

Two children (5 & 8), we took a suite where one had a roll out bed, another slept on a really big sofa and we had a very large bed. It worked well. Breakfast is the best you will get.

"3 Jalan Stesen Sentral, Kuala Lumpur 50470 Malaysia",Hilton Kuala Lumpur,"Not the best experience. If you’re young and Asian, you’ll probably get ignored at the Executive Lounge. Came here more than once during my 2-night stay and was consistently not provided the same service and attention that other guests got immediately when they arrived and stayed in the lounge. Is it stereotyping & discriminating? Not for me to determine. Other than this, the housekeeping staff were incredibly helpful, the breakfast food was wonderful, and the overall facilities seemed okay. Will probably try other places before returning.",

"3 Jalan Stesen Sentral, Kuala Lumpur 50470 Malaysia",Hilton Kuala Lumpur,"This is a review of the Lobby Lounge where we had an afternoon snack. It was a very expensive tea/coffee at around RM38 a cup. We also had some cakes. Firstly, the service was very very slow. It was difficult to catch anybody’s attention to ask what was going on. When the tea came, I asked for some cold milk, but I got hot milk. When I asked to change it to what I had requested which was cold milk, there was no apology, just another long wait for the cold milk. The cakes came shortly after the tea and coffee but did it seem very fresh. Overall, it was a disappointment for the amount paid.",

I arrived at 4pm but was told my room was not ready. The check in staff offered me another room which was not a Lake View. I was shocked with the suggestion as this would be a downgrade from the room I had booked. I of course refused this and said I would wait in the lounge until my room was ready. I was brought to the lounge and then told that my room was actually ready. Not sure why I was informed otherwise at the reception. Could be they just wanted to downgrade me? The credit card machine was also not working at check in so the hotel could not collect a deposit and I could not charge anything to the room. This was rather inconvenient. The room I was…,
